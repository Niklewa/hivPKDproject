# hivPKDproject


In this project I am analyzing the data provided by the polish hiv association. The data are the result of a survey that is filled by the medical professional during the classificatory interview at the PKD (punkt konslutacyjno diagtnostyczny). There is at least one PKD in every main administratory region (wojew√≥dztwo) in Poland.

Note on large files: repo will automatically use LFS on .zip extension files and also some of the folders
